                <h2>What is the ESF Film Festival?</h2>

                <p>Participants submit a 5-7 minute film about an important social issue, in any style, convention or form. This is combined with a photographic portfolio of twenty photos recording their process.</p>
                <p>The best six submissions will be exhibited at the prestigious ESF Film Festival, and will be judged by a panel of experts for three awards - Most Creative; Best Cinematography; and Best Film (Overall). Winners will each receive prestigious trophies, along with prizes such as camera gear and cinema coupons.</p>
                <p>The ESF Film Festival was initiated by AWARE.</p>
